# OpenSourceFinalProject

This repo contains a small Hello World project using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. The main project has a simple custom number library as a dependency. 
Since the library is small and custom-made, the project is protected by the MIT License. The license allows anyone to use the project, with only one condition: 
license and copyright notice. Once the proper credit is given, the user can use the code for commercial use, distribution, modification, and private use. Thus, the project is available to 
use by anyone free of charge. A more thorough explanation can be found next to the README tab or [here.](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

The library only contains a bool method, determining whether the input whole number is even. It takes an integer as a parameter, first checking if the value is null. 
Otherwise, it'll check if the number divisible by two equals zero. If so, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. To test this function, the main project 
contains an integer variable that receives a random number from a range of zero to two hundred. The result will then be inserted into another variable object called input. 
The input will then be inserted into the bool method to check if it's an even number. Finally, the console will display the result.

Since the project is small and acts as a starting base, an invitation is made to anyone who finds my code to use it as they choose. I encourage people to make alternations for 
improvement, suggest more methods to the library, or use the library as an addition to their projects.
